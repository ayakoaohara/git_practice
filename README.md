# Why I find the article interesting
While American-led internet is market driven, there is a growing movement to impose rules on the web. The main motivation is to regulate hate speech, prevent terrorism, and contents that may harm children. When the regulator notices harmful content, it can issue fines to companies that hosts the website or block access to the websites.</br>
While it is assumed that the internet is no longer a free and unregulated space, I was surprised to hear that a government is taking an active and public step for further regulation. It is very interesting to compare this proposal to the current debate in the United States, where platforms such as Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter are still having a difficult time responding to the surge of contents, such as fake news.

In the time that we live in where our tech giants get hold of a lot of user-created content, I do think that it is important to keep things in check, e.g. for fake news, ethics of advertising etc. However, it is really hard for us to draw the line on what is considered censorship and how implications for our the West's model of democracy.
